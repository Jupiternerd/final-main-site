        <p>
            Taco.com actually isn't about tacos. It's about a company called Technical Advisors Custom solutions for all Occasions. Even 
            though they are not related to the food, they use the recognizable name and images of a taco to build their brand and I think
            that's pretty clever.

        <h4>Breakdown</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            It's a simple website and most of it is to the point about their company. But the way they organize their data is strange in that
            they use the &lttable&gt tag to organize their data and I haven't really seen it used before in that way. I am guessing that since
            it is a website built long before the new modern web, they had to use the tools that were available to them at the time.

            The HTML is quite simple, it's a lot of &lttable&gt tags that organize into two columns that has rows of text and images. The left-panel
            is the navigation table with tacos as the image and strangely the text in the bottom is baked into the image and not rendered as text.
            The right panel is the main content column of the website with texts and each paragraph is divided into rows with the &lttr&gt tag.

            The website is not responsive but it doesn't need to be when it is this simple and as with the assignment before it does it's job and has
            it's charms.
