        <h4>What's interesting to you in this article/work and why?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The website was really interesting and a lot of it's points really resonated with me. It's a simple website, but it not being complex does not
            necessarily make it less impactful. At the end of the day, the content that you put on the website is what matters and as Min would say "The content
            in the website is graceful and practical..."
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Do you agree or disagree with the author, why?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            I agree with the author. I also believe that even with all the new tech stacks and frameworks, as long as you can deliver the content it doesn't matter what you use.
            The end user will not care about the tech stack you used, they will care about the content you deliver.

        <h4>Other media (writings, images, videos, etc.) this article reminds you of, and how are they related?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            This reminded me of old websites that I *seen* in the past. I wasn't really in the generation that saw the early early old websites like geocities. I wish I was born a decade earlier
            to experience the explosion of the internet. As you can see by the design of this website, I am a fan of the old internet aesthetic. I do have a faint memory of using wnidows XP but most
            of my childhood was spent on Windows 7 so it wasn't as retro as XP. But websites back then had a soul, they had a personality and many wesites were built by regular people, albeit a bit nerdy
            but they were passionate enough to trasnfer their personality onto their websites. I think that's pretty cool and resonates with the article as well. They didn't have highly technical stacks
            with frameworks so they had to rely on their creativity to make their websites stand out.
